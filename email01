I would like to provide an update regarding the recent installation of the IZPCA product on the sandbox environment, along with some context on its intended use and the current limitations within the sandbox LPAR.

As you are aware, IZPCA is utilized primarily for processing and analyzing SMF data, which it ingests and stores within its internal DB2 database. Once the data is available, reporting can be produced through multiple interfaces. Under normal circumstances, QMF and GDDM are the standard tools leveraged to generate formatted IZPCA reports. In environments where QMF is not available, reports can still be produced by directly querying the DB2 tables, and the product also supports integration with additional reporting solutions such as Cognos.

It is important to highlight that our sandbox environment does not currently have QMF or GDDM installed. As a result, while the IZPCA installation is fully functional, the scope of meaningful work we can perform on the sandbox LPAR is inherently limited. The full reporting and analysis capabilities will become available once we transition to the test LPAR, where the required tooling and supporting components are in place. From a broader organizational perspective, ensuring these components are aligned across environments will be essential for maximizing the product’s value and avoiding procedural bottlenecks downstream.

For your reference, I have prepared a detailed, in-depth technical document outlining the complete installation steps. In our case, the installation was performed through z/OSMF, which provided a streamlined and efficient deployment process. The document also includes the alternative SMP/E installation procedure to support teams or environments that may prefer or require a more traditional approach.

Please review the attached documentation at your convenience. I am available to discuss any questions, next steps, or environment readiness considerations as we plan the transition toward full implementation in the test LPAR.
