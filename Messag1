Thank you so much for the detailed message and for taking the time to review everything – this is already a really solid and helpful start! I truly appreciate the clarity you’ve brought to the command-conversion component and the real-time translation approach between ACF2 LPAR and RACF LPAR. Your questions and suggestions align very well with where we’re heading, and it’s great to get your perspective early in the process.
I’d love to hop on a short call to discuss your points in more detail, walk through the proposed architecture together, and make sure we’re all on the same page with scope and initial assumptions. That way I can also show you the current state of the tool framework we already have in progress and get your immediate feedback.
Please let me know what times work best for you over the next few days – I’m fairly flexible and happy to work around your schedule.
Looking forward to the discussion!
