Customer First
In our mainframe environment, which directly supports critical healthcare applications and millions of members, I consistently place the customer at the center of my work. For example, when stabilizing the THRDTERM REXX script to automatically cancel inactive DB2 threads, I focused on eliminating manual interventions that could delay issue resolution and impact application performance—ultimately ensuring faster, more reliable service for internal teams and end customers. Similarly, leading the first-time installation and configuration of IBM Z Performance and Capacity Analytics (IZPCA) provides the organization with advanced performance insights, enabling proactive capacity planning that supports uninterrupted delivery of healthcare services.
Transformational Leadership
I drive positive change by introducing modern tools and practices to our z/OS environment. Successfully installing and configuring Ansible for z/OS and progressing IZPCA implementation represent forward-thinking initiatives that modernize mainframe automation and analytics capabilities. I proactively research, test, and document new solutions (e.g., using z/OSMF, zopen utilities, and best practices), share knowledge with the team, and lay the foundation for improved efficiency and innovation in how we manage and monitor our systems.
Trust Working Together
Collaboration and transparency are central to my approach. Throughout projects such as the Omegamon upgrade, THRDTERM fixes, Ansible setup, and IZPCA rollout, I worked closely with DB2, RACF, automation, and other cross-functional teams—coordinating dependencies, communicating progress openly, and seeking input to ensure alignment. I maintain thorough documentation of all configurations, test results, and procedures, building trust through reliability, honesty, and a consistent willingness to support team objectives.
Purposeful Execution
I deliver results with clear focus, ownership, and excellence. All assigned goals—whether onboarding deeply into the mainframe environment, contributing to the Omegamon project, or delivering stable production fixes and new tools like IZPCA—have been completed on track or ahead of expectations. I set priorities effectively, conduct rigorous testing (Safety First), take calculated risks during implementations, and follow through end-to-end, consistently achieving high-quality outcomes that reduce manual effort, enhance system stability, and position the team for long-term success.
