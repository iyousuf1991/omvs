To successfully implement IBM Z Performance and Capacity Analytics (IZPCA) in our mainframe environment, delivering a fully functional tool for advanced SMF/RMF performance analysis, capacity planning, and reporting.

Lead the end-to-end installation and configuration of IBM Z Performance and Capacity Analytics (IZPCA) utilizing z/OSMF and SMP/E. Activate the data collector to enable SMF/RMF ingestion, perform comprehensive post-installation verification (including Db2 bindings and analytics database setup), and ensure dashboard accessibility. Extend the configuration to the Test LPAR, incorporating necessary QMF and GDDM components for full functionality. Collaborate effectively with DB2 and RACF teams to resolve dependencies, maintain thorough documentation of all procedures and outcomes, and ensure a stable, secure implementation that provides reliable performance insights and supports informed capacity planning decisions.
