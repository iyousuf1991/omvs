To successfully install and configure Ansible for z/OS in the mainframe environment, enabling reliable automation of configuration management and operational tasks.

Complete the full installation of Ansible for z/OS, including all required components and dependencies. Configure connectivity to the mainframe (z/OS systems), create and test initial playbooks for basic tasks such as pinging hosts, logging into TSO, and performing minimal configuration changes. Progress to advanced playbooks leveraging z/OS-specific modules (e.g., zos_job, zos_data_set, zos_operator) to support operational automation. Collaborate with the team to ensure best practices, security compliance, and integration with existing processes, ultimately establishing a stable and functional Ansible environment for ongoing mainframe automation.
